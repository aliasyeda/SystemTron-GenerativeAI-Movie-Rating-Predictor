# 🎬 Movie Rating Prediction using Generative AI

This project predicts IMDb movie ratings based on the movie's metadata (title, genre, director, stars) using **Generative AI techniques**. We utilize pre-trained language models to understand and generate meaningful embeddings from text, and then use machine learning to predict numerical ratings.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Traditional ML models often rely on manual feature engineering. In contrast, this project uses **text embeddings** generated by a **pre-trained transformer model** (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to capture semantic meaning from movie details.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- SentenceTransformers (MiniLM model)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset

We used the [IMDb India Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sagnik1511/imdb-indian-movies-2023) from Kaggle which includes:
- Title
- Genre
- Director
- Stars
- IMDb Rating

## 📌 Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Loaded IMDb dataset
- Selected useful columns: `Title`, `Genre`, `Director`, `Star1`, and `IMDB Rating`
- Combined the text features into one single text column

### 2. Generating Text Embeddings (Generative AI Part)
- Loaded `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model from SentenceTransformers
- Generated dense numerical embeddings for each movie using `model.encode()`

### 3. Splitting Data
- Divided data into training and testing sets (80/20 split)

### 4. Model Building
- Trained a `RandomForestRegressor` model on the sentence embeddings
- Tuned with default hyperparameters

### 5. Evaluation
- Used MAE, RMSE, and R² Score
- Plotted Actual vs Predicted Ratings to visualize performance

### 6. New Prediction
- Allowed users to input new movie data (e.g., title, genre, director, actors)
- Encoded it and predicted IMDb rating using the trained model

## 📊 Sample Output

![Scatter Plot](./Scatter.plot.png)

- Each dot represents a movie.
- Red line = ideal prediction (perfect match).
- Dots close to the red line = accurate predictions.
- Most predictions are accurate around the middle rating range.

## 🤖 How Generative AI Was Used

- We used a **pre-trained transformer model** (`MiniLM`) to convert movie text into embeddings.
- These embeddings capture **semantic meaning**, enabling smarter prediction than just keyword matching.

🧠 Future Improvements

Try using deeper transformer models like BERT or GPT.

Add more metadata like description, reviews, or runtime.

Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.
